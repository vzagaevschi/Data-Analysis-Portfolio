## Dataset
The Dataset: Immigration to Moldova from 2014 to 2021 (Imigranti dupa tara de emigrare si scopul sosirii, 2014-2021]) from National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova. 

Dataset Source: [Populatia si procesele demografice: Imigranti dupa tara de emigrare si scopul sosirii, 2014-2021](https://statbank.statistica.md/PxWeb/pxweb/ro/20%20Populatia%20si%20procesele%20demografice/20%20Populatia%20si%20procesele%20demografice__POPrec__POP070/POP070100rcl.px/?rxid=b2ff27d7-0b96-43c9-934b-42e1a2a9a774).

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international immigrants to the Republic of Moldova as recorded by the countries of destination for period of 2014-2021. The data includes factors such as the country, years, number of people moving  and reasons for moving.


## Analysis
The analysis is conducted in Jupyter Notebook using Python programming language and its data analysis libraries such as pandas  and matplotlib. The following steps are carried out in the analysis process:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: MS Excel was used to perform data cleaning and pre-processing tasks before conducting analysis in Python.  This includes handling missing values, duplicates and incorrect data, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

2. Data Exploration: This includes exploring the distribution of variables, identifying relationships and patterns in the data, and computing summary statistics.

3. Data Visualization: This includes creating various plots and charts to visually represent the insights and patterns found in the data. TBD more datailed

4. Data Modelling: This includes building models such as regression and classification models to predict certain outcomes based on the data. TBD

5. Results and Conclusion: The insights and findings were summarized, and conclusions were drawn based on the data analysis. TBD

## Findings
The key findings from the analysis are highlighted in the Jupyter Notebook and the accompanying visualizations. 

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates my ability to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data, and to present my findings in a clear and concise manner. The insights and visualizations generated from the data provide valuable information for decision making and future research.

So, five top countries that contributed the most to immigration to Moldova for the years 2014-2021 are Ukraine, Russia, Romania, Turkey, and Israel. Data and plot shows that Ukraine had the highest number of immigrants to Moldova, followed by Russia and Romania. Turkey had the fourth highest number of immigrants, and Israel had the lowest among the five countries. The total column represents the cumulative number of immigrants from the five countries over the eight-year period.

Based on the data, the following can be concluded:
- Ukraine has consistently been the leading country of origin for immigrants to Moldova, with a total of 5,787 immigrants over the eight-year period. It will be necessary and interesting to compare the data with immigration in 2022, which will certainly be much higher due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
- Russia has had a fluctuating number of immigrants to Moldova, with a peak in 2016 and a dip in 2020.
- Romania has had a decrease in the number of immigrants to Moldova over the years, with the highest number of immigrants in 2014 and the lowest in 2021.
- Turkey has had a significant increase in the number of immigrants to Moldova in the recent years, with the highest number in 2021.
- Israel has had the least number of immigrants to Moldova, with a total of 2,839 over the eight-year period, and the numbers of immigrants decreased over the years.
